Second Capstone - Using ASP.NET MVC, AngularJS and Entity Framework

The idea is to let users upload any two related items and have other users vote on their preference.  Either for fun, or actual constructive feedback.

### TO-DO Prior to Publishing
<ul>
<li>Fix Azure "published" database errors not present on localhost.</li>
<li>Create splash page.</li>
<li>Finish time-out animation.</li>
<li>Re-style login/register.</li>
<li>Disable capstone (presentation) only features - multiple votes per user.</li>
</ul>
